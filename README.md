- **Repository status:** Public repository. Keep examples, docs, and issues free of credentials, private data, and machine-specific paths.
- **Topics:** agents, ai, awesome, claude, claude-code, hooks, mcp, skills, slash-commands

## What This Project Is For

- Curated, battle-tested Claude Code toolkit: 9 agents, 11 skills, 15 commands, rules, hooks & 15 MCP configs — install as a plugin or copy in.
- Find repository risks early without exposing secrets in reports.
- Make security review repeatable across public and private codebases.

## Where It Fits

This repository belongs in the trust-and-safety layer of the workbench: it helps make code, configuration, and public handoffs safer before they are reused or shown to clients.

## Quick Start

No universal setup command is declared yet. Start by inspecting the repository map above and the project-specific scripts or docs committed with the code.

## Operating Notes

- Keep real credentials out of the repository. Use local environment files, GitHub repository secrets, or the deployment platform secret manager.
- If a `.env.example` file exists, treat it as documentation only; never commit filled-in `.env` files.
- Before publishing screenshots, demos, or client examples, remove private names, internal paths, account IDs, and API endpoints.
- The `Repository Hygiene` workflow is a lightweight guardrail, not a replacement for product-specific tests.

## Delivery Checklist

- [ ] README describes the user, business outcome, and operating boundary.
- [ ] Setup or preview commands are current and do not rely on private machine state.
- [ ] No real secrets, private user data, or machine-local state are tracked.
- [ ] Screenshots, demos, or sample outputs are safe to share publicly when the repository is public.
- [ ] Product-specific tests or smoke checks are documented before production use.

## Roadmap

- Tighten the fastest path from clone to useful demo.
- Add project-specific screenshots, sample outputs, or a short walkthrough where useful.
- Promote repeated manual steps into scripts, tests, or documented workflows.
- Keep security, privacy, and licensing boundaries explicit as the project evolves.

## Maintainer Notes

Maintained by [Tony Sheng](https://github.com/shengdabai). This README is written as a business-facing handoff: it should help a future collaborator, client, or reviewer understand why the repository exists, how to inspect it, and what must be true before it is reused or shipped.
